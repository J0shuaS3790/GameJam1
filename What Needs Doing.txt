Things to add:
- Game name!!!
- Change some Dialogue / add minor story (Beginning and end).
- General sound effects.
- Music.


Issues:
- Level 2: Chest disappears when picking up without the key, so you can't try again with the key.
	Fix: Make the chest a sprite, so it does not disappear if you don't have the key.

- Level 2: Exits to move between room 1 and 2 do not line up.

- Level 3: Dialogue needs fixing.

- All: Coin pickups trigger the "time to go" text in new levels.
	Fix: Use the score variable instead of coin amount. / Reset coin amount in each level.


Misc Improvements:
- Add the "you still need Â£x to leave" in all levels.
- Some decoration should be solid (i.e: the whale).
- Some decoration should be changed to tiles (from sprites), so they can be reused (i.e: level 1 fishes).
- Double check the invisible items in level 3, not sure if they're in every tile.
- Make level 3 harder by lowering the number of "turns".
- Change difficulty of bombs to make them more of a threat. (I.E: only one or two ends the game).
